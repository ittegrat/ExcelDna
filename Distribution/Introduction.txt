Introducing Excel-DNA - DotNet for Applications
===============================================

Excel-DNA brings .NET to Excel power users and developers. The primary target is the Excel user who currently writes VBA code for functions and macros, and would like to start using .NET. An additional audience is C/C++ -based .xll add-in developers who want to use the .NET framework to develop their add-ins.

Excel-DNA is free for all use, and distributed under a permissive open-source license that also allows commercial use (the OSI approved zlib license).
